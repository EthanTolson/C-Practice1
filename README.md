# C-Practice1 - Overview

I decided to learn C++ and decided that creating the game of checkers would be a great way to apply what I learned.
I also learned about OpenGL a very popular library for C++ that handles graphics.

I was able to create a program that uses header files, classes, arrays, various data types, input and output, and external libraries. 
the software has a main function and one class. The checkersGame class contains the actions the player takes and updates pieces.
Main handles the graphics and the creation of the checkersGame object and use of its functions.


I wrote this software to show the knowledge that I have gained over the past two weeks about the C++ language.
I had no background with C++ and wanted to challenge myself to create a functioning program that included all of the things I had learned.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
