# C-Practice1 - Overview

I decided to learn C++ and decided that creating the game of checkers would be a great way to apply what I learned.
I also learned about OpenGL a very popular library for C++ that handles graphics.

I was able to create a program that uses header files, classes, arrays, various data types, input and output, and external libraries. 
the software has a main function and one class. The checkersGame class contains the actions the player takes and updates pieces.
Main handles the graphics and the creation of the checkersGame object and use of its functions.


I wrote this software to show the knowledge that I have gained over the past two weeks about the C++ language.
I had no background with C++ and wanted to challenge myself to create a functioning program that included all of the things I had learned.

# Before You Run
* Use Visual Studio
* Change the External Include Directories to the include file within the project
* Change the Library Directories to the lib file within the project

# How To Play
* To move a piece enter the position of the piece you want to move and the place you want it to end up ex. 9 13
* To jump a piece enter the position of the piece doing the jumping and the place the piece will end up after the jump ex. 13 22
* Board looks like this:

  Red  |  29   |  Red  |  30   |  Red  |  31   |  Red  |  32
  

   25  |  Red  |  26   |  Red  |   27  |  Red  |  28   |  Red  
  

  Red  |  21   |  Red  |  22   |  Red  |  23   |  Red  |  24
 

  17   |  Red  |  18   |  Red  |  19   |  Red  |   20  |  Red  
 

  Red  |  13   |  Red  |  14   |  Red  |  15   |  Red  |  16


   09  |  Red  |   10  |  Red  |   11  |  Red  |   12  |  Red  


  Red  |  05   |  Red  |   06  |  Red  |   07  |  Red  |   08
